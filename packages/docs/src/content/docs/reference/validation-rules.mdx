Rapid form provides a simple way to validate form fields using the `refValidation` function. The `refValidation` function is used to validate the form fields and show the error messages based on the validation rules.

By default, Rapid Form validates the form fields on the `input` event. You can customize the validation event type and the validation rules for each form field, and reset the form values automatically after its submission.

Let's the validations rules for the form required fields:

- `input` field has a minimum length of 1 characters (All types).
- `email` field has a valid email format based on regex.
  - `/^(([^<>()\[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+(\.[^<>()\[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+)*)|(".+"))@((\[[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\])|(([a-zA-Z\-0-9]+\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,}))$/`.
- `password` field has a minimum length of 6 characters.
- `checkbox` field is required.
- `radio` field is required.
- `select` field is required.
